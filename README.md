# ImageSaliencyModel

This is the repository for my Capstone project with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). I have created a R Shiny UI that wraps around MATLAB code. This creates a web based interface to upload images and video files and perform image saliency analysis.

The two main MATLAB scripts are
1. hMapClrOppGDDNM
2. cSalMapComb

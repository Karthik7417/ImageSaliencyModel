# ImageSaliencyModel

This is the repository for my Capstone project with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). I am helping in translating the code form MATLAB to R. 

There are 2 main scripts that need to be translated. These two scripts use additional subscripts that may need to be translated too. 

The two main scripts are
1. hMapClrOppGDDNM
2. cSalMapComb
